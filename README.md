As digitalization has gotten more ubiquitous in our lives, we realized the importance of embedding the ideas and logic of computational thinking from an early age. Hence, this game is aimed at school students, especially primary and secondary school students, who want to get a headstart in learning the basics of programming but are intimidated by a text-based interface, such as that of common programming languages on text editors or IDEs.

In this game, the player has to solve a maze by moving a certain object (player object) to another end goal object (treasure object). However, instead of directly moving the player object, the player needs to queue the commands and press an execute button before the player object can move based on the commands. Therefore, it teaches the person playing the game to think systematically and algorithmically while planning to give instructions to the object. If the player object hits a wall object or doesn’t reach the treasure object, a message will pop up saying that the player hit a wall or didn’t reach the treasure, and the level repeats. You are highly advised to see the GameDemonstration.mp4 file to see how the game works.

If you have python in your own laptop already, just open the AlgorithmMazeGame.py file and run it in any IDE or code editor that supports python to play the game. Otherwise you can also go to https://replit.com/@NathanAW24/AlgorithmMazeGame#main.py and run the script.
